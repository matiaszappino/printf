.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "holberton.h"
int printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function in the _printf produce output according to a format. The function writes output to
.IB stdout.

.SH - Return Value
Upon successful return, the function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the
null byte used to end output to strings).
.SH - Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier. In between there may be flags.
The arguments must correspond properly with the conversion specifier.
.SH - Conversion specifiers
.SS b
The int argument is converted to signed binary notation.
.SS c
 If no l modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.SS d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.SS p
Print the address which the pointer points to.
.SS o, u, x, X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation. The letters abcdef are used for x conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for X conversions.
.SS R
Prints the string in rot13 encryption.
.SS r
Prints the string in reverse.
.SS s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').
.SS S
Prints non printable characters as \x and their ASCII value in hexadecimal.
.SS %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
.SH EXAMPLE
.SS To print a simple string followed by a new line.

 int main() {
 char *s = "Hey Betty";
 _printf("%s\\n", s);
 return (0);
 }

.SS To print an integer followed by a new line.
